        <p>Reading online can be a better experience than reading printed matter.</p>
        <p>The purpose of SRAid is to enhance the on-screen reading experience in order to make it better than on-paper reading, by leveraging the computer capabilities.</p>
        <p>It benefits both the *publishers or authors* and the *readers*.</p>
        <p>Firstly, more comfortable reading is good news to both parts: the reader is interested in reading, and the publisher or author is interested in being read.</p>
        <p>The enhanced experience will allow the readers to read more, which is the shared craving.</p>
        <p>Although it's focused mainly on rather lengthy texts, like books or papers, it is also amenable for much-shorter blogs or articles</div></p>
    </div>

    <div class="row-fluid section2">
      <div class="span5 offset1 copy copy-right">
        <p>Moreover, in addition to enhancing the on-screen reading, the SRAid builds a record of the readers' wanderings along the text, like how much time they spent on each section or chapter of the publication.</p>
        <p>This might be of some interest or the reader, like for example to evaluate the remaining time needed to finish studying a subject based on the time used so far.</p>
        <p>The publisher doesn't see the individual records, but the big picture, that tells her how her readers are doing with the publication, how much effort are they willing to spend in its consumption, where they quit, and additional data like where are they in the world.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="span5 copy">
        <p>The SRAid comes with a number of advantage features, things that a paper can't do.</p>
        <p>Like for example remembering the reading position across devices, like you read in your desktop computer before going to bed, then the other day you open the publication in your tablet to continue reading in the train and of course it opens exactly where you left the night before. And so on, across all your devices.</p>
        <p>Like for example that the text scrolls the way you want it to, precisely and softly, for example by paragraph.</p>
        <p>Like SRAid remembers your reading positions to get you back to the right point in the text after a detour to check something in a previous chapter.</p>

        <p>SRAid is for HTML documents. It can be used even with documents not specifically published with SRAid features.</p>
        <p>There are <em>client features</em> and <em>server features</em>.</p>
        <p>The client features are things that happen in the browser.</p>
        <p>The driving idea is to make SRAid as minimalistic as possible, not cluttering the page with a number of artifacts. Actually, there is a single button that brings up the SRAid user interface containing the necessary buttons.</p>
        <p>One such button is the TOC (Table Of Contents) control. When selected, the TOC is displayed overlying the current page. It contains additional data:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The TOC items link to any bookmarks and notes related to each item.</li>
          <li>The parts of the document that are already read appear different than the untouched sections.</li>
          <li>The entries in the TOC can be used to display additional information like when a section was read, during how much time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After the reader is done with the TOC and dismisses it, she is taken back where to the original reading point where the detour started, even if it included seeing other sections of the document.</p>
        <p>Some elements of the document like images and tables can be "detached" to allow seeing then simultaneously with the text (provided that there is enough screen real estate available). This is to spare the annoyance of reading an explanation to something that is out of sight, like for example on the other side of a page.</p>
        <p>Scrolling the text with SRAid is a smooth experience. You can use the regular scrolling control which will perform as usual, but SRAid adds a <em>paragraph scroller</em> controlled by the space bar in computers with keyboards, and with an equally convenient control in other devices. The paragraph scroller will normally scroll forward a paragraph, parking it softly and precisely at the top of your reading window. It doesn't try to bring up the illusion of the turn of a page, is simply repositions the content so you can see it, and does it in a way so that you can clearly see what's happened.</p>

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>About the product itself, now it's in a stage of prototyping. </p>
        <p>Its design, which is based on deep knowledge and practice on usability matters, 
        is being put to test and checked against reality. Actually, what it does is to
        enhance the online reading experience with a severe usability boost.  </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As of today, it's still not clear how the product will be monetized. </p>
        <p>Because it is of interest both for the publishers and for the readers, then
        there might be different versions. </p>
        <p>Firstly, a free version, as is customary with the internet products that are
        to be consumed by the millions. </p> 
        <p>The free version will be functional for a number of users, and at the same time 
        it will not tax our resources because of its limitations. </p>
        <p>The second version is the individual's. It's for the readers. It will work
        the same as the free version (a browser extension) but the user's data will be
        persisted in the database, allowing the user to leverage the full potential of
        the tool. </p>
        <p>The last version is for publishers. A company that publishes lengthy documents,
        like for example <a href="https://www.10gen.com/">10gen (the owners of MongoDB)</a>, 
        might want to enhance their users' reading experience by publishing their documents
        with SRAid and gets a license to run the data services on their premises, or to use
        our's at a price. </p>
        <p>The license can be a free one (for non-profit organizations) or a paid one for
        companies that pursue revenue. In the example, 10gen needs bost, one for the database
        documents (because it's free) and the other for the site where they sell services. </p>
